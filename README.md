# GitHub Beginner Experiments
This repository contains the initial code I created when learning to use GitHub as part of DSCI 8133, *Foundations of Data Science* at Mississippi State University.

---

## **Plan**
Future plans for this repository include adding a sample data file and a [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebook that will interact with the file.
## **About Me**
I am Casey Love and I work in the QSR industry.  **Data Science** is becoming one of my passions.
My data science competencies include:
- Microsoft Excel
- R
- Tableau *limited exposure*
- Python *limited exposure*

In order to test the inclusion of a photograph, I've included a photo of a Data Scientist writing code that I created with the Generative AI tool "Midjourney":
